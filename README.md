# 🚗 TorqueX – Car Price Prediction

TorqueX is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the price of a car based on key features like kilometers driven and whether the car is old or new. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and integration into a Flask web interface for real-time predictions.
